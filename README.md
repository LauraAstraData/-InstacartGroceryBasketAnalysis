# -InstacartGroceryBasketAnalysis
working on identifying the sales pattern of an online grocery store.
Key questions to answer are:
- the sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are
- are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts
- are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 

Data set from: “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on May 2021 with modified names for data privacy.

The project´s goal is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of the online grocery shopping datasets and derive the first insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.
The segmentation considered the following customer criteria: age range, income, family status, beverage consumption classified as alcoholic/non-alcoholic.
The marketing goal is to identify segmentation so to strengthen the marketing campaign and target specific customer categories.
