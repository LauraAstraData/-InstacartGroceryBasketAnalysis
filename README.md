# -InstacartGroceryBasketAnalysis
working on identifying the sales pattern of an online grocery store.
Key questions to answer are:
- the sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are
- are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts
- are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
